 Filelight README
==================

Filelight allows you to understand exactly where your diskspace is being used by
graphically representating your filesystem as a set of concentric
segmented-rings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Dependencies
==============

Filelight works on KDElibs >= 4.2 and therefore Qt >= 4.4 (lower versions may
work, but no guarantees).


 Usage Tips
============

* Click on directories to center the view there
* Click on files to launch the application associated with them
* Middle click to open files/directories with Konqueror
* Right click on the central white circle to manipulate the base directory
* Increase the window size to see more detail
* Hover over segments to find out more information
* Available as a view-KPart in Konqueror
* You can specify a directory to scan on startup from the command line, eg:

      $ filelight /home/mxcl


 Installation
==============

See the accompanying file; INSTALL.
