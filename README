  FILELIGHT 0.6.3 ***
*********************

Filelight allows you to understand exactly where your diskspace is being used by
graphically representating your filesystem as a set of concentric
segmented-rings.


************
   FEATURES
************

* Click on directories to "zoom-in"
* Click on files to launch in the appropriate viewer (as configured in
  Konqueror)
* You can specify a directory to scan on startup at the command line eg:

  # filelight /home/mxcl

* Increase the window size for more detail - small files are hidden at smaller
  window sizes
* Hover over segments to find out more information about the region of the
  filesystem it represents

    INSTALL
************

See the accompanying file; INSTALL.

       BUGS
************

Filelight is still under development and I'd be most chuffed if you could report
bugs either through filelight@methylblue.com or the forums at
http://www.methylblue.com/filelight/

I hope you enjoy using Filelight!

Many thanks to Steffen Gerlach who came up with the method of representing
filesystem information with sets of concentric segemented-rings, Nikolaus
Regnat for making the debian packages and Herbert Graeber (aka Packman)
for the SuSE packages.
