 Filelight README
==================

Filelight allows you to understand exactly where your diskspace is being used by
graphically representating your filesystem as a set of concentric
segmented-rings.

README last updated with respect to 1.0-beta7


 Features
==========

* Click on directories to see them in more detail
* Click on files to launch in the appropriate viewer (as configured in
  Konqueror)
* Middle click to open files/directories with Konqueror
* Right click on the center white circle to manipulate the directory the view is
  centered about
* You can specify a directory to scan on startup at the command line eg:

  # filelight /home/mxcl

* Increase the window size for more detail - small files are hidden at smaller
  window sizes
* Hover over segments to find out more information about the region of the
  filesystem it represents
* Available as a KPart in Konqueror


 Install
=========

See the accompanying file; INSTALL.


 Bugs
======

Filelight is still under development and I'd be most chuffed if you could report
bugs either through filelight@methylblue.com or the forums at
http://www.methylblue.com/filelight/

I hope you enjoy using Filelight!
