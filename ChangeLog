1.0
    Added copy to clipboard function to segment context menus
    Accepts URLs from drag and drop
    Click central circle to go "up"

0.6.3
     Made "Scan Directory..." a KStdAction::open with setText( "Scan Directory..." );
     Swaped map rendering from bitBlt to paintPixmap (again) as some users get problems with the labels being obliterated
     LocationBar history is saved inbetween sessions for KDE >= 3.1.3
     Rescans are forced if locationBar Go is pushed for location to current map
     Fixed several bugs related to resizing the filemap
     Initial map display had a long running issue which meant you had to perform a resize to ensure all detail was shown. I finally put in the hours and fixed it.
     Cancelling scans clears the location bar
     Option to show files not represented as segments (because they are too small) combined in large segments with relevant summaries
     Directories that would normally have no child segments shown now have hidden Files segment shown
     Fixed faulty show/hide of progress box when many scans done in quick succession
     Session management
     Saving of Window/*bar settings inbetween sessions
     Fixed popup related non-updates and false action calls
     Canvas code cleanup
     Stopped combo activated scans being called twice
     Improved map generation speed (scan speeds are still slow however)
     Appropriate wait cursors are set during long operations (scans, map generation)
     Fixed misrendered transparency when tooltips exceed Filelight boundries
     Optimised and de-flickered the tooltips
     Segments that contain unrepresented files (due to 5 level limit on maps) now show a thick border at the edge to indicate that there are unrepresented files
     Commandline now accepts ../ and ./ type arguments
     Add "Open Konsole here" to context-menu, also tidied it up and made it properly context relevant
     Popup title is now relative to map path to reduce menu width somewhat without resorting to csqueeze()
     Fixed bug with not showing unrepresented files for dirs that contained dirs
     Improvement selection of units for tooltips (always prefer megabytes unless < 0.01 MB)
     Improved selection of decimal places for size display (2sig.fig. please)
     Label font sizes now default to the system standard
     Labels have indentation relative to their level
     Label selection improved (not enough yet though!)
     Better looking label line diagonals
     When smaller fonts are requested, Filelight maximises the font size differences
     Attempted to fix crash at exit bug
     Made files shades of gray, made indicator for directories that have unshown files
     Removed presence of multi-file segments except in root level circumstances (unless Show Small Files is selected in Settings)
     Contrast system revamped, you can now have more contrast
     Segment colouring system rewritten, better distinction between different segment types
     Used more KStdActions (less work for translation teams at very least)
     Fixed bug where segmenttip wasn't shown for 1st pixel but labels were
     Directories with unshown files have better arrow heads now thanks to some clever trig
     Checked for possible cases where division by zero might occur and corrected code
     Huge code rewrite in preparation for transition to KPart (must release soon, this is getting silly)
     Allow clicks on the central circle to represent the map's root (eg. middle-click to open in Konqi)
0.6.2
     Attempted a fix for the absurdly large file bug (eg > 1400GB!)
     Linking bug fixed for Gentoo systems
     Compile bug fixed for GCC < 3
     Fixed crash bug when scan had been stopped and then back then forward pressed
     Fixed another compile bug for systems that don't support large files (Debian apparently)
     Internationalisation support thanks to patch from André Somers
     Made the tooltip translucent (NOT a gimmick, this feature is essential IMO)
     Started making debug messages use kdDebug so users can enable/disable the messages
     Implemented XML GUI
     Vast slot/signal cleanup, fixed many bugs
     Fixed a few bugs with the progress box
     Cancelled scans now remain stored in the back/forward histories
     Fixed incorrect reporting of directory file counts
     Increased minimum segment size to 3px outer diameter (any depth)
     Added location_bar UI element to toolbar (much work)
     The segment tip now appears below the cursor when hovering over the upper part of the map
     Increased the recent scans list to 8 entries and made the combohistory work better
0.6.1
     Filelight again compiles on KDE <= 3.1.3 (but with some reduced functionality)
     Rewrote HistoryAction code
     Improved default choice of smallest font
     Lowest level segment labels show whenever mouse is not over anything
     Middle click opens segment according to mime type (eg. jpgs open in kuickshow)
     Implemented realtime contrast updates
     Added antialiasing, font size and contrast settings to appearance tab
     Renamed "colour scheme" tab "appearance"
     Extruded label fontsizes reflect their segment's depth
     Rescans ignore tree cache
     Changing scan options clears the tree cache
     Directory select dialog shows current path as selected when opened
     Scans no longer have to be repeated
     Implemented antialiasing for the map, very slow so only happens after resizes
     Gracefully handles failures to read file attributes
     Rewrote backend with templating, should have done that in first place!
     Improved changelog listing methods!
     Included support for GNU systems that don't support large files (>2GB)
