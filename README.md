# Filelight

Filelight allows you to understand exactly where your diskspace is being used by
graphically representating your filesystem as a set of concentric
segmented-rings.

# Useful Tips

- Click on directories to center the view there
- Click on files to launch the application associated with them
- Middle click to open files/directories with your file browser
- Increase the window size to see more detail
- Hover over segments to find out more information
- You can specify a directory to scan on startup from the command line like this: `filelight /home/me/foobar`
