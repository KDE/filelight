
 Filelight INSTALL
===================

Simply:

        $ ./configure && make && su -c "make install"

But, I recommend:

        $ CXXFLAGS="-O3" ./configure --enable-final --disable-debug \
            && make && su -c "make install"


 Troubleshooting
=================

Check you have the kde development packages installed, they'll be named
something like:

        kde-devel

This should pull in a lot of other development packages (unless they are already
installed) like:

        x11-devel
        qt-devel

If you get stuck, please email me the config.log file with any information you
can provide. I will get back to you! Compile issues suck, I know this full well.

I hope you enjoy using Filelight!
