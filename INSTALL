 Filelight INSTALL
===================

Simply:

	$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
		 && make && sudo make install

 Troubleshooting
=================

Check you have the kde development packages installed, they'll be named
something like:

        kde-devel

This should pull in a lot of other development packages (unless they are already
installed) like:

        x11-devel
        qt-devel

If you get stuck, please email me with any relevant information you can
provide. I will get back to you! Compile issues suck, I know this full well.
